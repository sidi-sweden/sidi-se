# About us

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Communicating independent, scientific and evidence-based information on drugs and drug therapies, openly and freely

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Foundation SIDI is a non-for-profit organisation. SIDI promotes the creation and free sharing of accurate information on drugs and in pharmacology.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SIDI promotes open and free sharing of information since we strongly believe that knowledge should be openly and transparently available. These two <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;conditions are necessary to achieve accurate and reliable information.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is SIDI's ambition to deliver innovative tools and procedures using information technology to provide high quality drug information for healthcare <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;staff, academic institutions and the public. To achieve that we are going to produce data sets and knowledge databases to be used in descision support and <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in education systems in the healh care sector. Furthermore we will deliver services analyzing ,exploring, cleaning, extracting, transforming  and <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;interlinking data from well known and authoritative datasets. In addition, we will develop tools to reach these services programmatically,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;facilitating the integration with systems in the healh care.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SIDI will support scientific projects in the area of drug informatics.

## Projects

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Running projects is costly and resource intensive. Because of that, initially SIDI conducts a small number of projects of its own. SIDI expects from<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; interested groups, individuals and from our members and supporters that they start projects on a voluntary basis. In this case, SIDI is going to support<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;them providing the means to set up a project environment including: wiki-tools, issue management tools, source code management and possibilities for <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;integration with other SIDI project's results.
