Medical and academic leadership is needed for clinical decision support systems.
Submitted by admin on Mon, 06/25/2012 - 15:31

In a medical comment in Läkartidningen, Lars L Gustafsson, describes the rationale of using good decision support prac­tice when developing and implementing clinical decision support systems. Unfortunately, this is not the case today and many of the rather few systems that are available are not usable, effective and safe. At least part of the problem is lack of medical leadership and anchoring in health care and academia. The whole article (in Swedish) can be found at http://www.lakartidningen.se/07engine.php?articleId=18365.
