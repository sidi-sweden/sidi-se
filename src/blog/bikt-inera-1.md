**SIDI** and **Inera** have agreed on cooperation to produce the database **BIKT** (from the Swedish "Biverknings√∂versikt" = Summary of adverse effects).

**BIKT** is a dataset containing information about undesirable adverse effects of medicinal drugs in  the Swedish market. **BIKT** covers at this moment about 50% of all medicinal drugs in the Swedish market and the ambition in the agreement is to constantly increase this figure all the time.

**SIDI** is going to deliver an updated and quality assured database once  a month to be integrated in the **Sil** database from **Inera**. The **Sil** database is used for decision support in the drug's prescription modules in the majority of the EHR systems in Sweden.
