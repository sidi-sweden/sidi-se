2011-05-11 - The County Administrative Board of Stockholm (L채nstyrelsen i Stockholms L채n) registered Swedish Institute for Drug Informatics (SIDI) as a Foundation in its Register of Foundations.

This is an important milestone in SIDIs existence that means that from now on, SIDI can get out and spread its message without formal impediment. We are pleased for that!
