SIDI has invited interested persons, institutions and
associations TO A WORKSHOP to establish KNOWLEDGE
SUPPORT FOR HEALTH AND MEDICINE AS A GENERAL
USEFULNESS.

The workshop took place on October 1 in Stockholm. 35 participants contributed with experiences from various multidisciplinary areas of concern for the knowledge support in healthcare.

Credible and independent knowledge should be available to healthcare professionals, patients and students in digital form and without hindrance.

HOPEFULLY, our workshop can also stimulate those interested to consider a career in the field of digital knowledge support.
